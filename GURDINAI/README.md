# GuardianAI: AI-Powered Video Analysis for Enhanced Security‚Äù

## Overview

The Shop Anomaly Detection System is a computer vision-based project that aims to detect anomalies, specifically the presence of weapons, in a shop or retail environment. The system utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to identify weapons and triggers alerts through email and WhatsApp messages.

## Features

- **Weapon Detection:** Utilizes YOLO object detection for real-time identification of weapons within the shop's surveillance feed.

- **Alerting System:** Sends alerts through both email and WhatsApp to notify the shop owner or relevant personnel when a weapon is detected.

- **Multimedia Alerts:** Email alerts include an attached image captured at the time of the detection to provide visual evidence.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pygame
- Twilio
- (Other dependencies specific to your project)
